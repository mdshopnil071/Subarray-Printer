Today I just learned # Subarray-Printer with JAVA
This Java program prints all possible subarrays of a given integer array and counts the total number of subarrays.
Description: A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. This program uses nested loops to generate every possible subarray and prints them one by one. At the end, it also prints the total number of subarrays.
How It Works:
The outer loop selects the starting index of the subarray.
The middle loop selects the ending index.
The inner loop prints all elements from the start to the end index.
A counter keeps track of how many subarrays are printed.
